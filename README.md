# Burger Prince Cash Register

This is a food/menu ordering system. Burger King menu items are used as default examples, however, this can be used as an internal ordering system for not only food or restaurants but for nearly any menu ordering environment. 

The application is written in C#.

The application is designed with the user in mind and is intended to be very user-friendly.

## Features
This is a ASP.NET MVC web application which includes the following features:

- Presents the menu and ordering options
- As items are added to the order, the user will see their order so far, including quantity, subtotal, tax and totall price
- You can remove an item
- Once finished ordering you can see your order summary (including each item's quantity and subtotal, tax and total amount)
- The program calculates the tax owed
- Once an order is completed, the order is saved to the database
- The app will keep track of your inventory
- A logged in user can view their previous orders
- Pickup or delivery option

Soon to be added features:

- Login with Facebook or Google

## How to Use
- To use this application, you can open it with [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/). If you are unsure which version to download, I recommend the free Community edition.
- This will soon be available online, but the source code can be downloaded from here and used freely.

[Here is a sample database](https://imgur.com/a/SoIrYnF) that can be used. Of course, you can split this table up into multiple tables, for example, creating a separate table for the category.
